Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 1297090 genes (95.9% of total) to 92317 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 64 or more genes (G50 was 64) and were contained in the largest 5000 orthogroups (O50 was 5000). There were 4 orthogroups with all species present and 0 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
